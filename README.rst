TimeSlot is the current placeholder name for a time tracking application
which can read your mind. Right now it is in such an alpha version that
nothing hardly works. Future plans include:

#. Smart suggestion system based on historic data
#. Companion mobile app
#. Voice activation
#. Checklists
#. Night mode

Since this is a *free and open source desktop app*, you can be sure:

#. You do not have to have internet access
#. Private data does not have to leave your computer
#. Private data is stored in encrypted form (not right now)
#. You cannot be forced to update to a version you don't like
#. You can always report bugs/suggest features in open and clear way
#. You can always inverst some time/effort and fix minor things yourself
